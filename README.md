I've made this into a separate project so the demonstration file isn't clogging up the toyModel project anymore. 

I created this demonstration to showcase my progress so far on the vultureUtils package to Orr, Marta, and Nili at our vulture meeting on 2022-08-08.

It includes the feeding and flight wrapper functions, and some basic operations with the finished networks, including testing them over time, computing densities, etc. The co-roost wrapper function isn't finished yet because I haven't figured out the edge lists, as of 2022-08-09.

It uses demonstration data from 2021-12-01 through 2022-06-01, just to limit it to a manageable size.

As with any other code using the vultureUtils package, you need to authenticate using your own login to movebank. I have my password saved in the movebankCredentials/ folder, which I have not pushed to GitHub for obvious reasons (then you would have my password!). To access the data and run this code, you would need to create that folder yourself and save your own password.
