I've made this into a separate project so the demonstration file isn't clogging up the toyModel project anymore. 

I created this demonstration to showcase my progress so far on the vultureUtils package to Orr, Marta, and Nili at our vulture meeting on 2022-08-08.

It includes the feeding and flight wrapper functions, and some basic operations with the finished networks, including testing them over time, computing densities, etc. The co-roost wrapper function isn't finished yet because I haven't figured out the edge lists, as of 2022-08-09.

It uses demonstration data from 2021-12-01 through 2022-06-01, just to limit it to a manageable size.
